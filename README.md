# League-Auto
Automate many things in League of Legends. Including auto accepting games, automatically picking your champion, and automatically banning a champion.

**USE AT OWN RISK, I HAVE YET TO DISCOVER IF THIS FOLLOWS THE GUIDELINES LEAGUE OF LEGENDS HAS IN PLACE**

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Install python
	https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Run setup.py
3. Edit settings.txt to your preferences, follow the instructions carefully inside settings.txt
4. Run Client.py

P.S Your windows resolution settings must be 1920x1080 resolution with zoom being 100% (THIS IS NORMALLY DEFAULT, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE 1920X1080 THE BOT WILL NOT WORK)

**WARNING: EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE AND TESTED WITH 1600X900 WINDOW SIZE OPTION IN THE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS CLIENT, I AM UNSURE IF IT WORKS WITH THE OTHER SIZES BUT YOU CAN SIMPLY GO TO SETTINGS, WINDOW SIZE AND THEN CHANGE TO 1600X900**
